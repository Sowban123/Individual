Longest Path with Largest Drop
Problem Description

Given a grid (2D array) of integers, find:

The longest path in the grid where you can move up, down, left, or right.

Among all such paths, determine the path with the largest drop.

Drop = difference between the largest and smallest numbers along the path.

Example

For the grid:

4 8 7 3
2 5 9 3
6 3 2 5
4 4 1 6


Longest path length = 5

Largest drop = 8

Input

A 2D integer grid of size M x N.

Output

Length of the longest path.

Largest drop along that path.

Rules

You can move in four directions: up, down, left, right.

Diagonal moves are not allowed.
